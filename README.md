training a neural network model to learn the XOR function, which takes two binary inputs and outputs 1 if they're different, and 0 if they're the same.

The code defines the training data as X_train (the inputs) and y_train (the expected outputs). We then define the model architecture using the Keras Sequential class, which allows us to add layers to the model. In this case, we're using two dense layers with ReLU and sigmoid activation functions, respectively.

We compile the model with a binary cross-entropy loss function and the Adam optimizer. We then fit the model to the training data using the fit method, specifying the number of epochs to train for.

Finally, we test the trained model on some new data (using the same inputs as the training data), and print the accuracy of the model's predictions.
